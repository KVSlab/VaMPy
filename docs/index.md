# The Vascular Modeling Pypeline

The Vascular Modeling Pypeline (VaMPy) is a collection of scripts to prepare, run, and analyze vascular morphologies.
This includes pre-processing scripts for generating a volumetric mesh, defining physiological boundary conditions, and
inserting probes for sampling velocity and pressure. For the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, we have
included two [Oasis](https://github.com/mikaem/Oasis) problem files for simulating flow in the [internal carotid artery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery) and the [left atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)). 
There are also a variety of post-processing scripts, which computes wall shear stress-based metrics, more advanced turbulence metrics, and a variety of morphological parameters.
